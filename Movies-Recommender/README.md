# Movie Recommender

This project aims to build a movie recommender system using Python and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The recommender system is built using content-based filtering, where the similarity between movies is calculated based on their descriptions, cast, and genres.

## Dataset

The dataset used for building this recommender system is sourced from Netflix titles. It includes information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix.

## Usage
Once the model is trained, you can use the content_recommender() function to get recommendations based on a given movie title.
