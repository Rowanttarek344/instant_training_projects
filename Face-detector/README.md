# Face Detection 

This Python program detects faces in an image using the OpenCV library and a pre-trained face detection model.

## Overview

The program uses the Haar Cascade classifier for face detection. It takes an input image, detects faces in it, and draws rectangles around the detected faces.

## Installation

To run the program, you need to have Python and OpenCV installed on your system.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine
2. Navigate to the directory containing the program files
3. Place the image you want to analyze in the same directory, and rename it to `image.jpg` (or change the file name in the code).
4. Run the program:

The program will display the input image with rectangles drawn around the detected faces.

## Customization

You can customize the program by changing parameters such as `scaleFactor`, `minNeighbors`, and `minSize` in the `detect_faces()` function to adjust the sensitivity and accuracy of face detection.
